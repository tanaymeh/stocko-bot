Predicting Google Stock Prices using Machine Learning.

For Geeks who understand ML:
This Machine Learning Model uses LSTM network (Long-Short-Term-Memory) to predict stock prices from a given Google Stock Prices Dataset. An LSTM Network, for instance; is an Recurrent Neural Network composed of LSTM units that helps the NN to exhibit 'Temporal Dynamic Behaviour' for a period of Time.
These types of Networks are best suited for prediction purposes like what I have done here.

You can think of this code to be divided into 2 Parts: (1. Data Pre-processing) and (2. Making + Training + Testing Neural Network)

To run this code, you need to have following dependencies installed on your filepath, where python is installed or in your Anaconda distribution.

```
pip install numpy
```
```
pip install scipy
```
```
pip install sklearn
```
```
pip install pandas
```
```
pip install keras
```

You could use Anaconda Distribution for this purpose either.
